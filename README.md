# Fun.Build [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Fun.Build)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fun.Build)

This is a project mainly used for CICD, you can use it in a fsharp project or as a script. You can check the **build.fsx** or **demo.fsx** under the root folder to check how the Fun.Build project itself is built and published to nuget.

The basic idea is you have **pipeline** which can contain multiple stages.  
Every **stage** can contain multiple steps. In the stage you can set it to run in parallel or run under some conditions (when envVar, cmdArg, branch etc.).  
Every **step** is just a **async<Result<unit, string>>**, string is for the error message. 

[Fun.Build.Cli](#funbuildcli--) is used to manage fsharp scripts which is using Fun.Build and tryPrintPipelineCommandHelp.

## For what

- Simple and straight forward DSL
- Type safety and extendable DSL
- Build and compose complex pipelines
- Test your pipelines locally
- Generate command line help information automatically

## Minimal example and conventions

```fsharp
#r "nuget: Fun.Build, 1.1.14"
open Fun.Build

pipeline "demo" {
    // configuration for pipeline itself goes first, like timeout, description etc.
    description "xxxx"
    
    // stages goes here
    stage "foo" {
        // configuration for stage itself goes first
        paralle   
        // steps or nested stages goes here
        run ...
    }
    
    // post stages goes here if you have any
    // post []
    
    // For script command usage, you can add below helper 
    runIfOnlySpecified
}

// For script command usage, you can add below helper
// You can run: dotnet fsi demo.fsx -- -h
tryPrintPipelineCommandHelp ()
```


## Print command line help information

You can call **tryPrintPipelineCommandHelp ()** at the end of your script to get some help infomation.  
Then you can run below command to get the help info: 
```bash
dotnet fsi build.fsx -- -h
```

You can also run below command without call **tryPrintPipelineCommandHelp** to get help info for pipeline which is set with **runIfOnlySpecified**:
```bash 
dotnet fsi build.fsx -- -p your_pipeline -h
```


## Example:

Below example covered most of the apis and usage example, take it as the documentsðŸ˜Š:

```fsharp
#r "nuget: Fun.Build, 1.1.14"

open Fun.Result
open Fun.Build

[<AutoOpen>]
module Extensions =
    open Fun.Build.Internal

    // Below is an example on how to create custom operation
    // If you want to use collapseGithubActionLogs in your project
    // You can access it by opening `Fun.Build.Github` in your file
    type PipelineBuilder with

        [<CustomOperation "collapseGithubActionLogs">]
        member inline this.collapseGithubActionLogs(build: Internal.BuildPipeline) =
            let build =
                this.runBeforeEachStage (build, (fun ctx -> if ctx.GetStageLevel() = 0 then printfn $"::group::{ctx.Name}"))
            this.runAfterEachStage (build, (fun ctx -> if ctx.GetStageLevel() = 0 then printfn "::endgroup::"))


// You can create a stage and reuse it in any pipeline or nested stages
let demo1 =
    stage "Ways to run something" {
        timeout 30 // You can set default timeout for the stage
        timeoutForStep 30 // You can set default timeout for step under the stage
        envVars [ "envKey", "envValue" ] // You can add or override environment variables
        // Use cmd, so we can encrypt sensitive argument for formatable string

## Fun.Build.Cli  [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Fun.Build.Cli)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fun.Build.Cli)

This is a dotnet tool package which can be used to manage the fsharp script which is using Fun.Build, and called **tryPrintPipelineCommandHelp**.

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Fun.Build.Cli
```

```
fun-build -h
```

```bash

Pipelines:

  source                          Manage source directory
    Options(collected from pipeline and stages):
      --list                      List current source directories
      --add                       Add source directory and build pipeline info cache for usage
      --remove                    Remove source from current source list
      --clean                     Clear all the cache files
      --refresh                   Rebuild pipelines and cache for current source again

  run (default)                   Execute pipeline found from sources
    Options(collected from pipeline and stages):
      --use-last-run              Execute the last pipeline
      --with-last-args            Use the last run arugments
```

After first setup, we can run it without any arguments, it will prompt related question to guide you.
